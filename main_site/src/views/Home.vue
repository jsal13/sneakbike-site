    <h1>What <i>is</i> Sneakbike?</h1>

    <p>Sneakbike is a community of people working towards two primary goals:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><b>Community</b>: Making friends, being nice to each other, and friendly competition.</li>
      <li><b>Learning New Skills</b>: A commitment to helping each other grow and learn new things.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>What does Sneakbike do?</h1>

    <p>The Sneakbike Community currently hosts two different events: <i>Sneakbike Mystery Races</i> and <i>Sneakly Weeklys</i>.</p>

    <div class="container-fluid ml-5">
      <h2>Sneakbike Mystery Races</h2>

      <p><b>Mystery Races are events where four similarly-skilled players race to complete an objective</b> in one, two,or three "mystery games" which are only revealed to the runners a few minutes before the race starts!</p>

      <h2>Sneakly Weeklys</h2>

      <p>This is the Sneakbike Community's "anything goes" event. It's a good time to try out some new event ideas or to have a community night.</p>

      <p>In the past we've had <i>non-mystery races, casual playthroughs of weird games, learning a speedrun together, teaching streams, learning randomizer games, hollow knight randomizer bingo</i>, and sometimes we just hang out and play games together.</p>

    <h1>What's the Sneakbike Toolkit?</h1>

    <p>The Sneakbike Toolkit (SBTK) is our lightweight, open-source solution to having a number of individuals stream on the same stream. It allows us to easily host races with a number of runners. To use or play around with the code, check out <a href="https://github.com/jsal13/sneakbike/" target="_blank">our github</a>.</p>
